    A class named DisableCamera is defined with methods to interact with the Windows API for disabling the camera.

    Initializing the Class:
    An instance of the DisableCamera class is created.

    Disabling the Camera:
    The disable method of the DisableCamera class is called to disable the camera by sending a specific message to the system using the SendMessageW function from the Windows API.

    Printing the Status:
    The status of the operation is printed to the console, indicating whether the camera was successfully disabled or if there was an error.
